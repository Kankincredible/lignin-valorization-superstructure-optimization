# Lignin valorization superstructure optimization

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the "A Superstructure-Based Lignin Valorization Process Optimization Model for Lignocellulosic Biorefineries through Biological Upgrading" project. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of lignocellulosic biorefinery optimization. It contains the necessary code and data to facilitate the understanding and application of a novel approach to valorize lignin through biological upgrading methods.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose in the context of the project:

### 1. Base Case Scenarios
- **`base-case-upg`**: This folder contains the model and data for the base case scenario where lignin is valorized through our proposed process. It includes the Pyomo framework-based model files and the associated datasets required to simulate and analyze the lignin valorization scenario.
- **`base-case-burn`**: This directory houses the model and data for the base case scenario without lignin valorization. Here, lignin is considered as a burnable waste product. This section is essential for comparative analyses and understanding the impact of lignin valorization.

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis
- **`sensitivity-analysis`**: This folder includes all the sensitivity analysis result data. It provides valuable insights into how different parameters affect the performance and outcomes of the lignin valorization process. These results are crucial for optimizing the process under various operational conditions.

## Usage
To use the models and data in this repository, you will need to have Python installed along with the Pyomo framework. Detailed instructions on how to set up the environment and run the models are provided in each respective folder.
