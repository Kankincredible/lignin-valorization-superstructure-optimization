# Lignin valorization superstructure optimization

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the "A Superstructure-Based Lignin Valorization Process Optimization Model for Lignocellulosic Biorefineries through Biological Upgrading" project. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of lignocellulosic biorefinery optimization. It contains the necessary code and data to facilitate the understanding and application of approaches to valorize lignin through biological upgrading methods.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose in the context of the project:

### 1. Base Case Scenarios
- **`base-case-upg`**: Contains Jupyter Notebook files with the model and integrated data for the base case scenario with lignin valorization.
- **`base-case-burn`**: This directory includes Jupyter Notebook files for the base case scenario without lignin valorization, where lignin is treated as a burnable waste. 

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis
- **`sensitivity-analysis`**: This folder includes sensitivity analysis result data, providing insights into how different parameters affect the performance of the lignin valorization process. The data is crucial for optimizing the process under various operational conditions.

## Usage
To use the models and data in this repository, you will need Python and the Pyomo framework installed. Detailed instructions for setting up the environment and running the models are provided in the `setup_environment.py` file.
